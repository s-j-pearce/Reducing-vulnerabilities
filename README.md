## 0.0 Introduction
In this report I am going to be discussing the question; "How to reduce vulnerabilities in a system during development?". I will break the report up into several sections, the first will be primary research where i will take a look at the results from the questionnaires that i handed out. The second section is going to be about secondary research, this will be what other sources have discovered through their research methods. Third will be where i compare the two sets of research and their results. The fourth and final section will be a conclusion to the report.

### 0.1 What is software development?
Software development is the process or the course of making a system/application. These systems or applications will then run on a piece of hardware. A key and important step when developing these systems is making sure that they are secure. There is always going to be the risk of new ways for vulnerabilities to arise when developing software however it is important to make sure that you try and minimise these risks or vulnerabilities during the development stage. 

### 0.2 What are vulnerabilities?
The definition for a vulnerability is the quality or state of being exposed to the possibility of being attacked or harmed, either physically or emotionally. In computer security, a vulnerability is a weakness which could be exploited by a threat. These threats could perform unauthorised actions within the computer system which could have malicious intent. A vulnerability can cause a lot of problem for not only users but also developers, this is because not only could it mean users could have important information taken away from them but also the developer who programmed the system could receive backlash from these vulnerabilities.  
Another way of describing a vulnerability could be a loophole, these loopholes provide a user with malicious intent to gain access to content that they are not supposed too. For instance, if a banking application had a vulnerability then it has the potential to be catastrophic as this could mean that if someone knew how to exploit these vulnerabilities then they could be used to gain information about customers, banking records or even transactions.  

### 0.3 Difference between Qualitative and Quantitative research:
When applying research there are two main types to consider, these are **Qualitative** and **Quantitative**. **Qualitative** is where the main goal from asking a specific question is to gain quality feedback or evidence. This can be done by asking a question which requires a more complex answer. Quantitative is where the main goal is to get a numerical value from the questions, for instance you might ask how many hours sleep they get on average each night. The answer should only be a numerical value whereas if the question was qualitative then it might ask, how well would you say you sleep at night, this way it gives the participant the opportunity to give a detailed response.

## 1.0 primary research
As my main goal from this report is to find out how to reduce vulnerabilities in a system during its development i thought that it might be best to ask some software development students to get their knowledge and understanding. The Questionnaire that I have given them to complete will have some questions in relation to cyber security and software vulnerabilities. Through analysing the results i hope to answer three questions. The three questions are below:

--- 
1. How important do software developers find their own password protection?

For the first question i wanted to find out just how important software developers considered their own passwords. My reasoning behind this was that a lot of applications that are used to develop software or even the systems that they are used on require password protection to keep the information and data safe, therefore if an individual gained access to the system or application then they can make changes or install viruses, trojans or malware onto the system. I believe that in order to make sure that no one is able to tamper with your work, you need to keep it safe and secure with a very secure passcode as a first line of defence.

The image below shows the results of 2 questions from my questionnaire that help towards answering my first overall question. The first question within my questionnaire that i asked to help understand my first main question was; "On a scale of 1-10, 1 being not very secure and 10 being very secure, how secure do you think your password is?" I asked this question as i wanted to gain an understanding to see how secure the participants thought their password was. As you can see from the results there is a clear mix between how people rate their password. To the far right you can also see that there is an average of 6.8/10, this shows that from these results the average for the 20 participants was 6.8/10 which means that they believe their passwords are fairly secure however they don’t see them as very secure.

For the second question i wanted to ask the participants to see if they knew out of the two given examples which password would take the longest to crack. I used this as a second question as i wanted to compare the results from the first question with this question. I would do this by looking who thought their password was very secure and who got the question wrong, by doing this it would show who is unclear on what makes up a secure password. From the results 7/10 people who got this question wrong believed that their personal password was very secure. This correlation shows and leads me to believe that young developers are unaware of what makes up a secure password which leaves them vulnerable to attacks.

As a way to show how the results from the two questions correlate i have created the box chart as seen below. The box chart was a perfect way to show the results as it allowed me to put into perspective just how the questions would connect. Taking a look at the results on the chart, it is simple to understand; the highest and lowest results are shown on the chart by

2. What vulnerabilities do student software developers know?

I wanted the answer to this question because i wanted to see what vulnerabilities software developers would already look out for and try to prevent. If a software developer was experienced and knowledgeable then they would understand and try to prevent ways of users gaining access in an unwanted attack. The more vulnerabilities that a software developer knows then the less mistake or loopholes are going to appear in their code. As you can see from the screenshot below i asked the main question: "Other than a virus, can you name any other types of vulnerabilities" The results show that only a small number of participants could name a more advanced vulnerability e.g. SQL injection and brute force. This leads me to believe that the participants are not as educated in vulnerabilities as they should be.

3. Has anyone of the participants ever experienced a form of cyber attack and if not how do they prevent it from happening?

With this last question i wanted to find out how many people had experienced a cyber or attack or how many haven’t. The reason for this is so i can see how many people take care and make sure that they keep their own personal data safe and secure. A good software developer will always make sure to protect and store their data and private files safely. I also wanted to see how many software developers have made simple mistakes and allowed themselves to receive a form of cyber-attack big or small, it still shows a breach in their own security methods.

To answer the final main question i started by asking to see if any of the participants had experienced any form of cyber-attack and if so what it was. out of the 20 participants, 12 have experienced a form of cyber-attack, whether it be a small form of attack like a friend trying to log into their account or a serious attack where someone’s personal accounts are accessed. After reviewing the results i determined that 5 out of the 12 people who had experienced a form of attack, had experienced a serious form of attack. 

My final question; "How do you keep your personal details safe whilst you're online? “is there so I could see the precautions that the participants were and are taking whilst online.

The image below is the full results of my questionnaire. I put all of the information that i have received into a excel spreadsheet in order for me to easily analyse and see the results in terms of numbers. For instance, I am able to see the average of how secure people think their password is. I can also use the data to see who thinks their password is secure but they got the next question wrong, which is: "Out of the two passwords below, which one do you feel will take the longest to crack?" using the spreadsheet I could easily see that 7 people who said that they think their password was rated above 5/10 got the second question about a more secure password wrong which shows that they don’t really know how secure their password is or in this case how unsecure it is.

## 2.0 secondary research

---
### 2.1 Case study #1: (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43128072) 
For the first study we are going to start by looking at a report by the BBC. The report States that more than 52% of Britons aged 18-25 use the same password for multiple online services. Just of this initial statement this is leaving a lot of people vulnerable for attack. By using the same password for multiple accounts, it makes it very easy for someone to hack in to just one account but also gain access to the others.

The study also states that 79% of the people they asked had sent sensitive data over a messaging service which makes them very vulnerable for attack. If their account gets hacked, then it is possible for a hacker to gain access to this information. Some of the sensitive information that was shared through the messaging services include: Bank statements, electronic copies of signatures and other important documents. A lot of this sensitive data is left in the sent mail section which is usually the first place a hacker will check.  
The study also shows that if an individual reuses the same password for different accounts or applications then this helps ‘cyber-thieves’ to gain access to your precious data. Usually operators of larger firms will try their best to protect your login details by deleting old passwords etc, smaller firms may not be so equipped and fall victim during a data breach. Usually when there is a data breach and a hacker gains access to peoples account information, they wont just stop at that one account or profile. They will try to use the same information to access other accounts and gain as much data from you as possible.
Another survey that was carried out for this research also showed that on average, people regularly used at least six online accounts which could be anything from social media to online shopping. Within the survey some also said that they have as many as 21 other accounts that they log into on a regular basis which obviously increases their risk exponentially.
Along with the study about how many online accounts people used. There was also an interesting finding that 27% of young people would use the same key identifier that unlocked their email if their password had been forgotten. This means that all a hacker needs to do Is gain access to that answer from a previous data breach from a smaller less covered company and then they have all of your data.
After the survey was released, in a response, the UK’s cyber aware campaign recommended that people start using strong and separate passwords for their email accounts. The recommendation also suggested that people not use names of children, pets or a sports team for their password as this is some of the easiest information to gain access too through social media and other outlets.
The main recommendation from this study though is the use of two-factor verification where possible. Two-factor verification is where users would need to enter a unique code to log in. this code would be sent to a place of the user’s preference usually. The most common being email or their phone by a text message.

### 2.2 Case study #2: (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40850174)
A new study has suggested that cyber-criminals will start to search and attack newly set up servers. An experiment by the BBC asked a security company to carry out an investigation to take a look at the traffic that visited newly set up servers. The experiment showed that just 71 minutes after a server was set up, it was visited by automated attack tools that would scan the server for weaknesses that could be exploited. The experiment also showed that once the new server had been identified and shown as vulnerable, the server would receive a constant wave from attack tools.
The experiment was left online for around 170 hours in order to form a cyber-attack sampling tool which is better known as a honeypot. The servers themselves were given real, public IP addresses and other identifying information that would make them discoverable online. According to the experiment, to make it more realistic, each server was also configured to superficially resemble a legitimate server. Each of the servers could accept requests for web pages, file transfers and secure networking.
Obviously as this was just an investigation there was no more depth put into the servers meaning that they were not capable od doing anything more than providing a very basic response to some queries. The basic queries consisted of basic net services and protocols. 
The experiment showed that the servers very limited responses did not deter the automated attack tools or bots. It showed that a wide range of attack bots probed the servers looking for weaknesses that could easily be exploited if they were the real deal. Even if the bots did gain access or successfully attack the server, there was nothing there for them to find.
A lot of the code vulnerabilities and other loopholes had already been acknowledged before the experiment took place. They left these in place due to the fact that many organisations sometimes struggle to keep their servers up-to-date with software patches that would fix them. If the updates had been implemented, then these bots would potentially not be able to gain access for the attackers.
Some statistics from the experiment:
*  17% of the attack bots were scrapers that sought to suck up all the web content they found
* 37% looked for vulnerabilities in web apps or tried well-known admin passwords
* 10% checked for bugs in web applications the servers might have been running
* 29% tried to get at user accounts using brute force techniques that tried commonly used passwords
* 7% sought loopholes in the operating system software the servers were supposedly running
According to the study, these were very typical patterns for the automated bots. 
Whilst doing this experiment, the company that run the tests also wanted to find out how quickly phishing gangs would start to target new employees within the BBC. The test started by seeding 100 legitimate marketing email lists with spoof addresses and then they waited to see what else would show up. After around 24 hours, they started to see the first trapped phishing email come through into the emails inbox. This email was followed by a steady number of other messages that sought to trick people in other ways into opening the malicious attachments.
Apparently around 15% of the emails would contain a link which would direct users to a compromised webpage that if they actually visited, it would launch an attack that could possibly compromise the visitor’s computer. The other 85% of the phishing messages just had malicious attachments. Some of these attachments came in the shape of Microsoft office documents, PDF files and executable files.

## 3.0 comparison of both sets of research

The overall aim of this report is to find out how to reduce vulnerabilities in a system during development. I first selected the two case studies as a way of gaining some knowledge from an alternate source about vulnerabilities. The first case study was about how young brits lack cyber security awareness. Now with this first case study the main purpose of including it is because a lot of young developers may fall into this category or may even relate to the study. I wanted to learn just how sever the lack of knowledge was overall because there will be young developers that may have been selected for the study and if that is the case then their results will also coincide to show just how vulnerable young developers are to being attacked through the web. 
The second case study that I selected was catching the hackers in the act. Now I wanted to use this study as it shows just how quickly newly set up servers and accounts are targeted. Now as a developer, if you are a new employee or a new business or possibly even just upgrading your server hardware, this puts them at risk for attack. Whether it is receiving phishing emails with links or attachments which can gain access to your data or automated bots designed to extract data from servers. This study shows that it can happen as quickly as 71 minutes after being set up. This leaves development companies that may be expanding either with their server equipment or just employees, both these methods can create or even seek out vulnerabilities.

Now to look at my research and why I have looked into what I have. The main goal of my research was to answer three main questions; 
1. How important do software developers find their own password protection?
2. What vulnerabilities do student software developers know?
3. Has anyone of the participants ever experienced a form of cyber-attack and if not how do they prevent it from happening?

Now the reason I wanted to answer those three specific questions after reading the two case studies was because; the questionnaire was only given to young developers and therefore I wanted to see what precautions they were already putting into place to protect their work, even before they might be working on a major project. I also wanted to know if the young developers already know some vulnerabilities to look out for and protect themselves against for the future. And lastly, I wanted to see if anyone had ever experienced a form of cyber-attack as well as if not, what are the young developers doing to prevent them from occurring for them.
From my three main questions I basically wanted to see if young developers were already educated enough to help prevent vulnerabilities during their current work and when they eventually get a job working on larger projects where it will matter the most. The study’s highlight the current risks and vulnerabilities that companies and developers have to deal with and my own research is to find out if all of these recent studies have helped to educate younger developers so that if the two studies are redone in the future, will they show a reduction in vulnerabilities.
