## 0.0 Introduction
In this report I am going to be discussing the question; "How to reduce vulnerabilities in a system during development?". I will break the report up into several sections, the first will be primary research where i will take a look at the results from the questionaires that i handed out. The second section is going to be about secondary research, this will be what other sources have discovered through their research methods. Third will be where i compare the two sets of research and their results. The fourth and final section will be a conclusion to the report.

### What is software development?
Software development is the process or the course of making a system/application. These systems or applications will then run on a piece of hardware. A key and important step when developing these systems is making sure that they are secure. There is always going to be the risk of new ways for vulnerabilities to arise when developing software however it is important to make sure that you try and minimise these risks or vulnerabiliites during the development stage. 
### What are vulnerabilities?
Vulnerabilities within software can be known as bugs, glitches, errors or even flaws, these can be found in not only the software but also the operating system. Software vulnerabilites can easily be missed or left in the software by accident. In order to reduce the chance of this happening then it is important that the correct precausions are taken in order to firstly identify these vulnerabilities but also reduce or remove them.

## 1.0 primary research
As my main goal from this report is to find out how to reduce vulnerabilities in a system during its development i thought that it might be best to ask some software development students to get their knowledge and understanding. The Questionaire that i have given them to complete will have some questions in relation to cyber security and software vulnerabilities. Through analysing the results i hope to answer three questions. The three questions are below:

--- 
1. How important do software developers find their own password protection?

For the first question i wanted to find out just how important software developers considered their own passwords. My reasoning behind this was that a lot of applications that are used to develop software or even the systems that they are used on require password protection to keep the information and data safe, therefore if an individual gained access to the system or application then they can make changes or install viruses, trojans or malware onto the system. I believe that in order to make sure that no one is able to tamper with your work, you need to keep it safe and secure with a very secure passcode as a first line of defence.

2. What vulnerabilities do student software developers know?

I wanted the answer to this question because i wanted to see what vulnerabilities software developers would already look out for and try to prevent. If a software developer was experienced and knowledgable then they would understand and try to prevent ways of users gaining access in an unwanted attack. The more vulnerabiliites that a software developer knows then the less mistake or loopholes are going to appear in their code.

3. Has anyone of the participants ever experienced a form of cyber attack and if not how do they prevent it from happening?

With this last question i wanted to find out how many people had experienced a cyber or attack or how many havent. The reason for this is so i can see how many people take care and make sure that they keep their own personal data safe and secure. A good software developer will always make sure to protect and store their data and private files safely. I also wanted to see how many software developers have made simple mistakes and allowed themselves to recieve a form of cyber attack big or small, it still shows a breach in their own security methods.
