## 0.0 Introduction
In this report I am going to be discussing the question; "How to reduce vulnerabilities in a system during development?". I will break the report up into several sections, the first will be primary research where i will take a look at the results from the questionaires that i handed out. The second section is going to be about secondary research, this will be what other sources have discovered through their research methods. Third will be where i compare the two sets of research and their results. The fourth and final section will be a conclusion to the report.

### What is software development?
Software development is the process or the course of making a system/application. These systems or applications will then run on a piece of hardware. A key and important step when developing these systems is making sure that they are secure.
