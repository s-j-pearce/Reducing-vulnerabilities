## 0.0 Introduction
In this report I am going to be discussing the question; "How to reduce vulnerabilities in a system during development?". I will break the report up into several sections, the first will be primary research where i will take a look at the results from the questionaires that i handed out. The second section is going to be about secondary research, this will be what other sources have discovered through their research methods. Third will be where i compare the two sets of research and their results. The fourth and final section will be a conclusion to the report.

### 0.1 What is software development?
Software development is the process or the course of making a system/application. These systems or applications will then run on a piece of hardware. A key and important step when developing these systems is making sure that they are secure. There is always going to be the risk of new ways for vulnerabilities to arise when developing software however it is important to make sure that you try and minimise these risks or vulnerabiliites during the development stage. 

### 0.2 What are vulnerabilities?
The definition for a vulnerability is the quality or state of being exposed to the possibility of being attacked or harmed, either physically or emotionally. In computer security, a vulnerability is a weakness which could be exploited by a threat. These threats could perform unauthorised actions within the computer system which could have malicious intent. A vulnerability can cause a lot of problem for not only users but also developers, this is because not only could it mean users could have important information taken away from them but also the developer who programmed the system could receive backlash from these vulnerabilities.  
Another way of describing a vulnerability could be a loophole, these loopholes provide a user with malicious intent to gain access to content that they are not supposed too. For instance, if a banking application had a vulnerability then it has the potential to be catastrophic as this could mean that if someone knew how to exploit these vulnerabilities then they could be used to gain information about customers, banking records or even transactions.  

## 1.0 primary research
As my main goal from this report is to find out how to reduce vulnerabilities in a system during its development i thought that it might be best to ask some software development students to get their knowledge and understanding. The Questionaire that i have given them to complete will have some questions in relation to cyber security and software vulnerabilities. Through analysing the results i hope to answer three questions. The three questions are below:

--- 
1. How important do software developers find their own password protection?

For the first question i wanted to find out just how important software developers considered their own passwords. My reasoning behind this was that a lot of applications that are used to develop software or even the systems that they are used on require password protection to keep the information and data safe, therefore if an individual gained access to the system or application then they can make changes or install viruses, trojans or malware onto the system. I believe that in order to make sure that no one is able to tamper with your work, you need to keep it safe and secure with a very secure passcode as a first line of defence.

2. What vulnerabilities do student software developers know?

I wanted the answer to this question because i wanted to see what vulnerabilities software developers would already look out for and try to prevent. If a software developer was experienced and knowledgable then they would understand and try to prevent ways of users gaining access in an unwanted attack. The more vulnerabiliites that a software developer knows then the less mistake or loopholes are going to appear in their code.

3. Has anyone of the participants ever experienced a form of cyber attack and if not how do they prevent it from happening?

With this last question i wanted to find out how many people had experienced a cyber or attack or how many havent. The reason for this is so i can see how many people take care and make sure that they keep their own personal data safe and secure. A good software developer will always make sure to protect and store their data and private files safely. I also wanted to see how many software developers have made simple mistakes and allowed themselves to recieve a form of cyber attack big or small, it still shows a breach in their own security methods.

### 2.1 Case study #1: (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43128072) 
For the first study we are going to start by looking at a report by the BBC. The report States that more than 52% of Britons aged 18-25 use the same password for multiple online services. Just of this initial statement this is leaving a lot of people vulnerable for attack. By using the same password for multiple accounts it makes it very easy for someone to hack in to just one account but also gain access to the others.  
The study also states that 76% of the people they asked had sent sensitive data over a messaging service which makes them very vulnerable for attack. If their account gets hacked, then it is possible for a hacker to gain access to this information.
