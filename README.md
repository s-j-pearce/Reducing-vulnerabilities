## 0.0 Introduction
In this report I am going to be discussing the question; "How to reduce vulnerabilities in a system during development?". I will break the report up into several sections, the first will be primary research where i will take a look at the results from the questionaires that i handed out. The second section is going to be about secondary research, this will be what other sources have discovered through their research methods. Third will be where i compare the two sets of research and their results. The fourth and final section will be a conclusion to the report.

### What is software development?
Software development is the process or the course of making a system/application. These systems or applications will then run on a piece of hardware. A key and important step when developing these systems is making sure that they are secure. There is always going to be the risk of new ways for vulnerabilities to arise when developing software however it is important to make sure that you try and minimise these risks or vulnerabiliites during the development stage. 
### What are vulnerabilities?
Vulnerabilities within software can be known as bugs, glitches, errors or even flaws, these can be found in not only the software but also the operating system. Software vulnerabilites can easily be missed or left in the software by accident. In order to reduce the chance of this happening then it is important that the correct precausions are taken in order to firstly identify these vulnerabilities but also reduce or remove them.
